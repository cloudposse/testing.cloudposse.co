Terraform Reference Architecture that implements a [Geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) Module for an Automated Testing Organization in AWS.

This account is suitable for running automated tests of Terraform modules. 

__NOTE:__ Before creating the Testing infrastructure, you need to provision the [Parent ("Root") Organization](https://github.com/cloudposse/root.cloudposse.co) in AWS (because it creates resources needed for all other accounts). Follow the steps in [README](https://github.com/cloudposse/root.cloudposse.co) first. You need to do it only once.

## Introduction

We use [geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) to define and build world-class cloud infrastructures backed by AWS and powered by Kubernetes.

`geodesic` exposes many tools that can be used to define and provision AWS and Kubernetes resources.

Here is the list of tools we use to provision the `testing.cloudposse.co` infrastructure:

* [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault)
* [chamber](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber)
* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)


## Quick Start


### Setup AWS Role

__NOTE:__ You need to do it only once.

Configure AWS profile in `~/.aws/config`. Make sure to change username (username@cloudposse.com) to your own.

```bash
[profile cpco-testing-admin]
region=us-west-2
role_arn=arn:aws:iam::126450723953:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole
mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::323330167063:mfa/username@cloudposse.com
source_profile=cpco
```

### Install and setup aws-vault

__NOTE:__ You need to do it only once.

We use [aws-vault](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/aws-vault/) to store IAM credentials in your operating system's secure keystore and then generates temporary credentials from those to expose to your shell and applications.

Install [aws-vault](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/aws-vault/) on your local computer first.

On MacOS, you may use `homebrew cask`

```bash
brew cask install aws-vault
```

Then setup your secret credentials for AWS in `aws-vault`
```bash
aws-vault add --backend file cpco
```

__NOTE:__ You should set `AWS_VAULT_BACKEND=file` in your shell rc config (e.g. `~/.bashrc`) so it persists.

For more info, see [aws-vault](https://docs.cloudposse.com/tools/aws-vault/)


## Examples

### Build Docker Image

```
# Initialize the project's build-harness
make init

# Build docker image
make docker/build
```

### Install the wrapper shell
```bash
make install
```

### Run the shell
```bash
testing.cloudposse.co
```

### Login to AWS with your MFA device
```bash
assume-role
```

__NOTE:__ Before provisioning AWS resources with Terraform, you need to create `tfstate-backend` first (S3 bucket to store Terraform state and DynamoDB table for state locking).

Follow the steps in this [README](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-root-modules/blob/master/aws/tfstate-backend/). You need to do it only once.

After `tfstate-backend` has been provisioned, follow the rest of the instructions in the order shown below.


### Provision `dns` with Terraform

Change directory to `dns` folder
```bash
cd /conf/dns
```

Run Terraform
```bash
init-terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

For more info, see [geodesic-with-terraform](https://docs.cloudposse.com/geodesic/module/with-terraform/)

### Provision `cloudtrail` with Terraform

```bash
cd /conf/cloudtrail
init-terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Provision `chamber` with Terraform

```bash
cd /conf/chamber
init-terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```




## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  all                                 Initialize build-harness, install deps, build docker container, install wrapper script and run shell
  build                               Build docker image
  deps                                Install dependencies (if any)
  help                                This help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  install                             Install wrapper script from geodesic container
  push                                Push docker image to registry
  run                                 Start the geodesic shell by calling wrapper script

```
